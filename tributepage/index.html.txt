          <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b>( 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948
            ) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political
             ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful 
             campaign for India's independence from British rule, and to later 
             inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
              The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), 
              first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.
              Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti,
              a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence.
              Gandhi is considered the Father of the Nation in India and was commonly called Bapu.
